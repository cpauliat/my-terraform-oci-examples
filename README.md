# Some Terraform demo config files I created for OCI

Prequisites: Terraform 0.12 or later

To use the demos:

1. Get a copy of the Terraform files by downloading then unzipping file
   https://github.com/cpauliat/my-terraform-oci-examples/archive/master.zip
2. Install Terraform on your machine
3. Create an API key for your user in the CloudUI/console of your OCI tenancy
   (see https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm)
   You can use my script available at https://github.com/cpauliat/my-oci-scripts/blob/master/generate_api_keys.sh)
4. Cd to one of the demo folders
5. Copy file **terraform.tfvars.template** to **terraform.tfvars**
6. Edit and update file terraform.tfvars for this demo
7. run `terraform init` command in the folder containing .tf files (only needed once before first test)
8. run `terraform plan` to see what actions will be done (dry run)
9. run `terraform apply` to execute those actions and provision the infrastructure
10. Finally, run `terraform destroy` to delete objects created previously with `terraform apply`
